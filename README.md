This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming: forgetting to import necessary modules.  The `bug.hs` file contains code that attempts to use the `sort` function from `Data.List` without importing the module, leading to a compilation error. The solution, `bugSolution.hs`, demonstrates the correct way to import the module and resolve the error. This simple example highlights the importance of carefully managing imports in Haskell to avoid common pitfalls.
